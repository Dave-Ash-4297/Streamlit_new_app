[bd]Introduction[/bd][/p]

These documents are a formal communication and the language used is reflective of that. We hope that you understand. Please take the time to read these documents carefully.

[bd]Your Instructions[/bd][/p]
[#]We are instructed in relation to [qu1_dispute_nature].[/p]
[#]Per our recent discussions, we have agreed to [qu2_initial_steps].[/p]
[#]This matter may develop over time and the nature of disputes is that opposing parties often seek to present facts and matters in a way that is favourable to their own case. We therefore cannot predict every eventuality but we will work with you to advise on any significant developments and review the overall strategy should that be required. Insofar as changes in the future may have a material impact on any cost estimates provided, we will discuss that with you. We will notify you of any material changes by telephone or in correspondence and we will of course always confirm any verbal advice in writing whenever you request that from us.[/p]

[bd]Action Required To Be Taken By You[/bd][/p]
[u]Client Identification and Money Laundering[/u][/p]
[indiv]
[ind]Solicitors are required by law to obtain evidence of their client's identity and address to satisfy money laundering and client identification regulations. This includes clients that are corporate entities.[/p]
[ind]To comply with the individual identity requirement, you have two options:[/p]
[a]We can carry out a remote ID verification of you and your ID documents using a SmartSearch facility. If you would like us to verify your identification remotely please provide your name, address, date of birth, personal email and mobile number. Once the search has been undertaken, SmartSearch will send you a text or email with a link to use on your smartphone which will require you to take a photo of your ID document and then yourself which it will then upload to its system that will check the document, provide us with a copy, and verify that you are the person on the ID document. The process is quick and easy, and avoids you having to send in ID documents to us; or[/p]
[b]You can provide us with two documents referred to in the list below, one photographic and one showing your current address. If you are local to any of our offices please call with your original documents and they will be copied whilst you wait and the copies forwarded to us:[/p]
[ind][i]Current signed passport;[/p]
[ind][ii]Household utility bill;[/p]
[ind][iii]Residence permit issued by the Home Office to EEA nationals on sight of own country passport;[/p]
[ind][iv]Current UK or EEA photo-card driving licence;[/p]
[ind][v]Birth certificate;[/p]
[ind][vi]Marriage certificate;[/p]
[ind][vii]Bank statement dated within the last three months;[/p]
[ind]Please note that until these identification requirements have been satisfied, we may not be able to accept any money from you or make any substantial progress with your matter. It is therefore important that you provide your documents as soon as possible to avoid any delays.[/p]
[/indiv]
[corp]
[ind]Please provide your company registration documents and proof of registered address.[/p]
[/corp]

[u]Document Preservation and Disclosure[/u][/p]
[ind]In the event that your matter is litigated before a Court, all parties will be required to give full disclosure of all material relevant to the Dispute. It is therefore essential that you preserve any and all such material that includes correspondence, documents, emails, text and SMS messages and/or other electronic communications of any sort. Your disclosure obligations include an obligation to disclose material that may harm your case or help your opponent's case, as well as those on which you may rely or which help. If any device on which any such material is stored is to be disposed of or ceases to be used, you must ensure that copies are kept of the material.[/p]
